- error_msg: >
    exception TYPE raised (line XXX of "envir.ML"): expand_atom: ill-typed replacement
  explanation: |
    This error can occur if you bind and use a pattern in a lemma statement, e.g.

    ```
    lemma assumes "P foo" (is "P ?bar") shows "Q ?bar"
    ```

    This is due to the fact that parsing and type inference for the whole lemma statement is done at once.

    **Fix:**
    Sufficiently verbose type annotations might help, e.g.

    ```
    lemma assumes "P (foo ::'a)" (is "P ?bar") shows "Q (?bar :: 'a)"
    ```
- error_msg: >
    Bad Name: "t :: T"
  explanation: |
    When typing a definition and using type annotations at the wrong position, as in:

    ```
    definition "a :: bool" where "a ≡ False"
    ```
    
    Isabelle returns `Bad name: "a :: bool"`.

    **Fix:** use type annotations in the `where` clause instead:
    
    ```
    definition "a" where "a :: bool ≡ False"
    ```
- error_msg: >
    Not an equation | Not a meta-equality (≡)
  explanation: |
    Most commonly, these errors occur because Isabelle's equality `=` binds relatively strongly.
    For example

    ```
    definition d where "d b = b ∧ False"

    fun f where "f b = b ∧ False"
    ```

    lead both to above error.
    Isabelle parses the term `t b = b ∧ False` as `(t b = b) ∧ False` and not `t b = (b ∧ False)`.

    **Fix:**
    Explicitly set the parentheses, e.g. `t b = (b ∧ False)`

- error_msg: >
    (in an instantiation proof)
    Failed to refine any pending goal 
    Local statement fails to refine any pending goal
explanation: |
    When attempting to prove the necessary assumptions for the instantiation of a class, Isabelle may not infer the correct type.
    Assume there is a class `C`:
    ```
    class C =
    fixes f :: "'a option ⇒ 'a option"
    assumes "f None = None"
    ```
    When instantiating the class for an arbitrary type `ty`, one goal is: `P (f None)`.
    ```
    instantiation ty::C begin
    ...
    instance proof
        show "P (f None)" sorry
    ...
    qed
    end
    ```
    Isabelle does not infer the right type for `f` (since `f` may refer to another instantiation of `C`).

    **Fix:** Add a type annotation. For example:
    ```
        show "f None = (None :: int option)" sorry
    ```
